## Hi there, I'm Johan ğŸ‘‹

I build search and relevance systems at [Vespa.ai](https://vespa.ai) and tinker with database systems and compilers.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on query parsing and execution.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning compiler internals with a focus on intermediate representations (IR).
